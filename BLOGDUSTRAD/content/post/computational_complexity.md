# Introduction

Computational complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that deals with understanding the resources required by algorithms to solve computational problems. It helps us analyze and classify problems based on their inherent difficulty and the efficiency of potential solutions.

In this field, we aim to answer questions such as:
- How much time does it take for an algorithm to run as the input size grows?
- How does an algorithm's runtime behave under different scenarios?
- Can we find more efficient algorithms for specific tasks?

By studying computational complexity, we gain insights into the limitations and possibilities of computation, helping us design algorithms that are both practical and efficient for solving real-world problems.
